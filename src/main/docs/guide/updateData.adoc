To update data you can use a `PUT` request with the id and in the URI and data you want to change:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X PUT localhost:8080/products/1 -d '{"price":3.0}'
----

In this case the resulting output will be:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 200
X-Application-Context: application:development
Location: http://localhost:8080/products/1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:52:14 GMT

{"id":1,"name":"Orange","price":"$3.0"}
----

If you were to attempt update the data with an invalid value:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X PUT localhost:8080/products/1 -d '{"price":-2.0}'
----

Then an error response will be received:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 422
X-Application-Context: application:development
Location: http://localhost:8080/products/1
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 23 Nov 2016 08:54:25 GMT

----
