By default Grails will create an application that uses an http://h2database.com[H2 in-memory SQL database], thus allowing your to develop Grails without the need to setup a database.

However, if you do want to configure a database then you can do so by adding a runtime dependency to the corresponding JDBC driver to `build.gradle`. For example, for MySQL:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
dependencies {
    ...
    runtime 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:6.0.5'
}
----

And then altering the configuration found in `grails-app/conf/application.yml`. The default global configuration can be seen below:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tags=dataSourceConfig,indent=0]
----

You will notice that there is environment specific configuration:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tags=envConfig,indent=0]
----

Grails comes with three built in environments `development`, `test` and `production` corresponding to the different environments that the application will run in.

To alter this for MySQL you should specify the driver class name, username and password. In order to change it only for the `development` environment, you can specify it under the `development` block:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
development:
    dataSource:
        driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        dbCreate: create-drop
        url: jdbc:mysql://localhost/test
        username: xxxxx
        password: yyyyy
----
