To delete a `Product` simply send a `DELETE` request:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl -i -X DELETE localhost:8080/products/1
----

If deleting the instance was successful the output will be:

[source,bash]
----
HTTP/1.1 204
X-Application-Context: application:development
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
