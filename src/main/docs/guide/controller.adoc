With the data model defined now it time to write http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#controllers[a controller].

The quickest way to do that is with the `create-restful-controller` command from a terminal window:

[source,bash]
----
$ ./grailsw create-restful-controller hibernate.example.Product
| Created grails-app/controllers/hibernate/example/ProductController.groovy
----

However, you can also simply create the controller with your favourite text editor or IDE.

The contents of the controller should look like the following:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/controllers/hibernate/example/ProductController.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/controllers/hibernate/example/ProductController.groovy[tag=controller, indent=0]
}
----

The `RestfulController` super class will implement all the necessary operations to perform the common REST verbs such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. If is you wish to override or forbid certain verbs you can override the equivalent method from the super (for example the `delete` method for `DELETE`) to return an alternative or forbidden response.
