Grails uses http://views.grails.org[JSON Views] to represent render JSON responses. The idea being to continue the philosophy of separating the controller logic from the view logic.

The default view rendered if no specific view is found is `grails-app/views/object/_object.gson`:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/object/_object.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/object/_object.gson[indent=0]
----

The default `_object.gson` view simply uses the `g.render(..)` method to automatically produce a JSON representation of the object.

If you want to alter the output of the JSON the way that is done in Grails is by creating a view. You can generate a starting point with the `generate-views` command of the CLI:

[source,bash]
----
./grailsw generate-views hibernate.example.Product
| Rendered template index.gson to destination grails-app/views/product/index.gson
| Rendered template show.gson to destination grails-app/views/product/show.gson
| Rendered template _domain.gson to destination grails-app/views/product/_product.gson
----

As you can see 3 templates were generated:

* `grails-app/views/product/index.gson` - This view will be used when a collection (typically a list of results from GORM) is rendered via the `respond` method in a controller.
* `grails-app/views/product/show.gson` - This view will be rendered when a single `Product` instance is rendered via the `respond` method in a controller.
* `grails-app/views/product/_product.gson` - This is the template used by both the `index.gson` and `show.gson` views to actually display the data.

The contents of the `_product.gson` by default look like:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/product/_product.gson
----
import hibernate.example.Product

model {
    Product product
}

json g.render(product)
----

The call to `g.render(product)` outputs all properties.

However, the `json` property is an instance of Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.7/html/gapi/groovy/json/StreamingJsonBuilder.html[StreamingJsonBuilder] and you can use it to alter the output as per your needs.

For example:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/product/_product.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/product/_product.gson[indent=0]
----

In this trivialized example, we output the currency symbol based on the user's locale. Now the resulting JSON will look like:

[source,json]
----
[{id:1,"name":"Apple","price":"$2.0"}]
----

TIP: JSON Views are very flexible, for more information on customizing the output to your needs see http://views.grails.org[the documentation].
